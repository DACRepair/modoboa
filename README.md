# Modoboa Mail Server - http://modoboa.org/

Modoboa is a simple, easy to use mail server using common mail server utilities and an interface / manager written in Python.

This was forked from ServerKing's version of the Docker Modoboa image, but with some minor changes

- Volume for MailData / Config (WIP)
- ENV variable "servername" for specifying the mail server address.
